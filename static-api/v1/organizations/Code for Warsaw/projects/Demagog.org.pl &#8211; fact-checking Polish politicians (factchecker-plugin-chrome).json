Demagog’s goal is to keep an eye on the politicians’ public activity and check whether they are telling the truth, using a fact-check methodology. We analyse how politicians form their arguments, we check the underlying facts, and we label them with: “truth”, “lie”, “manipulation” or “impossible to verify”.</span>\r\n\r\nWe act as a registered Demagog Association, which goal is to enhance the quality of public debate in Poland and allow citizens to participate being properly informed.\r\n\r\nJoin us in our fact-checking work or help us with ICT-related challenges. We are currently working on a fresh website and a browser plugin to highlight checked statements.","link_url":"https://codeforpoland.org/projects/demagog-fact-checking/","name":"Demagog.org.pl &#8211; fact-checking Polish politicians (factchecker-plugin-chrome)"},"relationships":{"organization":{"data":{"type":"organization","id":"Code for Warsaw"},"links":{"related":"/organizations/Code for Warsaw.json"}}}}}
