Demagog’s goal is to keep an eye on the politicians’ public activity and check whether they are telling the truth, using a fact-check methodology. We analyse how politicians form their arguments, we check the underlying facts, and we label them with: “truth”, “lie”, “manipulation” or “impossible to verify”.</span>\r\n\r\nWe want people to consciously process information.
